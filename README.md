# My Emacs config

`.emacs` is for my personal configuration of emacs
and `.emacs.d` is the respective folder.

There is an icon set included at `.emacs.d/emacs.iconset/emacs.iconset`

If you wish to change your Emacs icon to this iconset, use

``
	sudo emacs /usr/share/applications/emacs25.desktop 
``

and change the `Icon=` to

``
	Icon=/home/[yourusername]/.emacs.d/emacs.iconset/emacs.iconset/512x512.png
``
