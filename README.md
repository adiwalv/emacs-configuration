# My Emacs config

Change `emacs` and `emacs.d` to `.emacs` and `.emacs.d`.

Copy these two things in your Home directory and voila you have your emacs setup!


There is an icon set included at `.emacs.d/emacs.iconset/emacs.iconset`

If you wish to change your Emacs icon to this iconset, use

``
	sudo emacs /usr/share/applications/emacs25.desktop 
``

and change the `Icon=` to

``
	Icon=/home/[yourusername]/.emacs.d/emacs.iconset/emacs.iconset/512x512.png
``
